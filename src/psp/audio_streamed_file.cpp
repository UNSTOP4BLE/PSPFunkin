 * maxFillLength can be used to limit the maximum number of samples that will be
 * decoded for each call to process(). This is useful for example if calling
 * process() once per frame as part of the main loop, to prevent audio decoding
 * from taking too much CPU time and eating into the time budget for the frame.
 *
 * Note that maxFillLength and DEFAULT_MAX_FILL_LENGTH must be high enough to
 * prevent buffer underruns. For example, if process() is called 60 times per
 * second to play a 44100 Hz stream, it must at the very least be 44100 / 60 =
 * 735 samples (but ideally should be more to prevent frame rate drops from
 * interrupting the stream).
